Observing differences across languages can reduce the analyst’s confidence in reliability and, by understanding the source of any discrepancies, one can reinstate confidence in reliability.\nThe goal of this project is to demystify conflict when doing QC and to help ease the transitions to new languages and techniques with comparison and comprehensive explanations.\n\n\nRWD Working Group\nThis is a newly formed working group, working on statistical programming guidelines while working on RWD (read world data)."
